## Flowla - Front-end coding challenge

Thank you for applying and participating in our front-end coding challenge.

### Introduction

In this challenge, we'd like you to help us build an online store for Flowla.

- We prepared the endpoint at `/api/items`, which returns a list of items. Please refrain from modifying the endpoint
- In `common/types.ts` you can find the typings for the request and response structures, as well as for the items. Please make sure to import and use them
- Below, you can see a rough wireframe of how the end result should look like
- You have complete freedom on how you build the project and the tools and techniques you use. Feel free to install and utilize any library, with one exception: 
- Please refrain from using ready-made UI kits, as we'd like to see how you utilize CSS and build out your components ⚠️ *Note: Using css utility frameworks such as Tailwind css is fine*
- You have freedom over the design. While modern and clean-looking designs are appreciated, we recommend not spending too much time making things look pretty, as you won't be evaluated based on it

**Objectives**
- Make a request to `/api/items` to get a list of items
  - The search bar at the top filters the results
  - Use the `?query=xxx` parameter to filter the results
  - No need to worry about pagination
- Display items in cards like those shown on the wireframe
- Each card has an "Add to cart" button, which adds the item to the shopping cart
- The panel on the side displays the items in your cart
- Items can be removed from the cart
- The total price is also shown inside the cart
